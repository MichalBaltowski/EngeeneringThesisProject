# EngeeneringThesisProject

*Hey*

**What is this?**
Here is the project that completes my academic path for the title of computer science engineer.
The title of the engineering thesis is "Design and implementation of a genetic algorithm in the Unity engine".

In my work, I develop a design and implementation of a racing car race application(repository includes only the application).
The aim of the test is for at least one car to pass the entire tour without hitting any obstacles.

**How it's working?**
Cars involved in a race are controlled through artificial Neural Networks.
Each car has own NN which takes five value from the sensors, and process it to determine velocity and steering direction.
The genetic algorithm is used to train whole population in order to create next population which is better adapted for the track
and go further.


Main objectives of my application:
• Implementation of an artificial neural network to driving vehicles.
• Implementation of the genetic algorithm, which ensured a situation where at least one car will finish a race

I attached:
• Project to be launched in the UNITY program,
• Instruction of how to launch application,
• Three text files with recorded results,
• Excel file with recorded results.
